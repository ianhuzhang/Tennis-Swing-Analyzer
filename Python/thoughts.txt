We have
x, y, z velocity as a 3-tuple
-> Absolute speed x^2+y^2+z^2
* Y is already set direction
-> We only need x^2+z^2
If we subtract controller pos from headset position
-> we have position relative to headset


-> absolute velocity > some threshold[tbd] = there is a swing in progress

-> near start, velocity is close to 0

-> near end 

* UI solves for making people face correct direction
-> Think on thresholds for velocity of swing for later


** Simulated Racket Head **

Calculate polar rotation of the controller ("What direction in xyz is up on the controller")
Add 29 inches in that direction on each line
Compute velocity from that position
Find max.


#Current Progress:
We have a decent discriminator for start/end
We have proof of concept that ML model is good at classifying

Immediate TO DO:
Figure out how to get it on a headset (i.e. run python on oculus in general)
We need to check that the start/end function works on continuous data [we may need to collect data for this]
    -> can check via subsets once we collect a long trace with multiple actions

Future TO DO:
Calculate simulated racket speed.
    -> consider collecting ground truth?
Existing follow through?
Body rotation

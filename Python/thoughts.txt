We have
x, y, z velocity as a 3-tuple
-> Absolute speed x^2+y^2+z^2
* Y is already set direction
-> We only need x^2+z^2
If we subtract controller pos from headset position
-> we have position relative to headset


-> absolute velocity > some threshold[tbd] = there is a swing in progress

-> near start, velocity is close to 0

-> near end 


* UI solves for making people face correct direction


-> Think on thresholds for velocity of swing for later

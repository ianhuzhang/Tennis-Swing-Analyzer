# Tennis Swing Analyzer
By Jason Chang, Lucien Liu, Ian Zhang

Tennis Swing Analyzer is designed to be run on the Meta Quest 2, as a virtual tennis coaching application that can automatically classify your swing as a forehand, backhand, serve, or volley, and provide specific analytics and advice tailored to the swing type. 

**Installation**

There are two methods to install the app:
1. Download the provided .apk file onto your device
2. Clone the repository, and open it as a project in Unity. Then, build to device, making sure you are targeting an Android Meta/Oculus Quest 2 device.

**Instructions on Use**
1. Open the application on the Meta Quest 2 device.
2. When the scene loads in, face the court and net. You should see "waiting" presented in the sky.
3. To begin tracking a swing, hold down the controller "A" button. To stop tracking, release the "A" button.
4. Feedback and analytics - both visual text and audio - will be provided after you stop recording

**Tips**
 - Tennis Swing Analyzer has a built-in activity detector, which will trim your recorded swing to the optimal length. Thus it is okay to start recording your swing early,
and end it late. However try not to start recording too late, or end the recording too early, as this might negatively affect the feedback!
 - You must face the net/court to get accurate measurements and analytics, as well as to see feedback. If this direction is not preferable, try exiting the application,
facing a preferred direction, then starting the app again.
